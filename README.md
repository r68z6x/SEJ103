ASSESSMENT TASK 4 (AT4) – DESIGN REPORT FOR BENDING ACTION
• Wind Turbine Bending and Shear Loading Design
• This is an Individual Assignment Report
• Weight: 35% of the Unit (hurdle applies for AT4)
Aim:
In Assessment Task 4, you are going to check your blade and tower design for bending, deflection and shear.

Figure 1: Wind Loading for Bending Design
KEY ASSUMPTIONS:
1. The design check will be based on the student design in AT3.
2. Wind will be assumed as whole gale force of 24.5 – 28.4 m/s matching the Beauford Scale [1].
3. Wind can be considered to be distributed evenly (as uniformly distributed load) for the whole height of the turbine for simplification.
Tasks to complete for the Report:
TASK 1 – BENDING AND DEFLECTION CHECK OF AT3 DESIGN:
Using the final optimised design from AT3 and any new parameters that need to be defined, perform. bending and deflection checks and identify if the design meets bending and deflection requirements.
TASK 2 – OPTIMISED WORKING DESIGN FOR BENDING AND SHEAR:
Develop an optimised solution for the blades and the column that still meets all the axial design requirements, meets shear requirements, while now being optimised for bending. This can be through material selection, material minimisation, selection of various open or close section (geometric details of the cross-section) or other methods.
You must also discuss what other failure 代 写SEJ103 ASSESSMENT TASK 4 (AT4) – DESIGN REPORT FOR BENDING ACTION T2 2024SQL
代做程序编程语言criteria (covered on Week 10) need to be considered for blade and tower. Provide detail, but concise explanation of how you have considered these criteria in your design choices/methodology. Your optimisations need to be clearly shown and explained.
Task 3 – DISCUSS YOUR AXIAL ONLY DESIGN VS BENDING DESIGN
Discuss and reflect on any similarities and any differences for your Wind Turbine Blade and Tower components in your design for Axial only loading compared to your Bending load design.
General Guidelines:
You will need to produce an Individual proposal report (approximately 10 pages).
You report should include:
• a brief explanation of the project and scope or the report.
• simple free body diagrams of the blades and the column (based off Appendix A and B) to identify the loads and key dimensions you are using.
• cross sections of the blades and tower (from AT3) and calculations to show if they can meet bending stress and bending deflection requirements.
• a section discussing which failure mechanism you have researched and ways you could address this type of failure in your design method (implementation accounting for this failure method is not required in this assignment).
• final cross sections of the blades and Tower and calculations supporting they can meet axial stress and axial deflection requirements, bending stress and bending deflection requirements, shear stress requirements.
